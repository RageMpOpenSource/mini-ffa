# Mini Free-For-All
**NOTE: Requires RAGE:MP 1.1**

A small Free-for-all gamemode to easy drop and play. This gamemode has the ability to create arenas and with each arena you assign a name, spawn points and weapons used in the arena. This is a lightweight gamemode and doesn't require any external databases to work.

Arenas can be loaded into the gamemode and used without server restarts. You will need to setup a command to reload the maps available to you to do this but hasn't been included.

A JSON database has been used as the most easiest and basic setup, this gamemode hasn't been designed to be used for a large community but will still do the job.

## Features
- Account system
